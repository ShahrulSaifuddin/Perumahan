# Plan 1.1 Summary: Project Scaffold & UI Foundation

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initialize Next.js App
  - Created Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind.
  - Moved to root directory.
- [x] Configure Claymorphism Theme
  - Installed `next-themes` and configured `ThemeProvider`.
  - Configured `tailwind.config.js` and `app/globals.css` with Claymorphism utilities.
  - Verified theme with `app/test-theme/page.tsx`.
- [x] Create Core Layout
  - Created `Sidebar`, `Header`, `Footer` components.
  - Implemented responsive layout in `app/layout.tsx`.

## Notes

- Had to manually install shadcn-ui dependencies and configure `components.json` due to yarn workspace issues.
- Downgraded to Tailwind v3 due to compatibility issues with shadcn-ui and PostCSS in the current environment.
