# Phase 6 Verification Summary

**Phase:** 6 - Advanced Reporting & Dashboard
**Status:** Code Complete (Ready for Manual Testing)

## Implemented Features

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard (`app/page.tsx`)

- **Stats Cards**: Displays Total Complaints, Resolved %, Funds Remaining, and Pending Actions.
- **Data Source**: `lib/api/dashboard.ts` fetches live counts from Supabase.
- **RBAC**:
  - **DBKL Admin**: Sees aggregated stats for ALL properties.
  - **Residents/Leaders**: Sees stats ONLY for their assigned property.

### 2. Interactive Charts (`features/dashboard/charts.tsx`)

- **Complaint Trends**: Bar chart showing complaints over the last 6 months.
- **Budget Utilization**: Pie chart showing Spent vs Remaining funds.
- **Library**: Uses `recharts` for responsive visualizations.

### 3. Resident Finance View

- **Integrated**: The main dashboard now serves as the personal finance view for residents, showing _their_ community's fund status.

## Verification Instructions

### 1. Prerequisite

- Ensure you have data (Complaints, Transactions) to see charts populate.

### 2. Manual Test

1.  Log in as **Resident**.
2.  View Dashboard.
3.  Verify "Funds Remaining" matches your property's allocation.
4.  Verify "Total Complaints" matches your property's complaints.
5.  Log in as **Super Admin**.
6.  View Dashboard.
7.  Verify numbers are higher (aggregated across all properties).

## Known Issues

- Charts rely on `created_at` dates; if all seed data is "today", charts will show a single bar/point.
