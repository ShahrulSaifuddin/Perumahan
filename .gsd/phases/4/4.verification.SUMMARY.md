# Phase 4 Verification Summary

**Phase:** 4 - Notifications & Polish
**Status:** Code Complete (Ready for Manual Testing)

## Implemented Features

### 1. Notifications (`lib/notifications.ts`)

- **Provider**: Resend (`resend` SDK).
- **Triggers**:
  - **Complaint Received**: Sent to Resident upon submission.
  - **Complaint Status Update**: Sent to Resident when status changes.
  - **Transaction Approved/Rejected**: Sent to Finance Officer/Resident when Leader acts.

### 2. UI Polish

- **Page Transitions**: Added `framer-motion` transitions between pages (`app/template.tsx`).
- **Email Templates**: Basic React Email template created in `components/email`.

## Verification Instructions

### 1. Test Build

- Ran `npm run build` to ensure no type errors with new libraries.

### 2. Manual Notification Test

1.  Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
2.  Submit a complaint as a Resident (with a real email).
3.  Check inbox for "Complaint Received".
4.  Log in as Admin, update status.
5.  Check inbox for "Complaint Update".

### 3. Visual Polish

1.  Navigate between pages.
2.  Verify smooth fade/slide transition.

## Known Issues

- Resend API Key must be valid for emails to actually send.
- "Refine Dashboard & Stats" was de-scoped vs original plan to focus on core notifications first (can be added in Milestone 2).
